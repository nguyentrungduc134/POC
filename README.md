# README: AWS CodePipeline, CloudFormation, S3, DNS, and Lambda Integration

This document describes how to set up and automate the deployment process using AWS services. It includes storing artifacts in S3, setting up DNS and parameters for client integration, syncing client buckets, and incorporating CodePipeline for deployment with approval and notifications.

## Overview

1. **Output CodePipeline and CloudFormation Artifacts to Separate S3 Buckets**
2. **Setup DNS, Parameters, CodePipeline, and Approval from the Client Site (Estimated Time: 5 Hours)**
    - Set up the CodePipeline source using an S3 ZIP file.
    - Configure an approval process and SNS notifications for pipeline stages.
3. **Sync with Client Buckets Using Prefix from Lambda (Estimated Time: 5 Hours)**

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Output CodePipeline and CloudFormation Artifacts to Separate S3 Buckets

- **Create S3 Buckets:**
  - One bucket for storing CodePipeline application artifacts.
  - One bucket for storing CloudFormation infrastructure templates.
- **CodePipeline Configuration:** 
  - In the CodePipeline YAML or configuration file, specify the output artifact locations.
  - Example:
    ```yaml
    Artifacts:
      - name: application-artifacts
        location: s3://<codepipeline-artifacts-bucket>
      - name: cloudformation-templates
        location: s3://<cloudformation-templates-bucket>
    ```

### 2. Setup DNS, Parameters, CodePipeline, and Approval from the Client Site (Estimated Time: 5 Hours)

- **DNS Configuration:**
  - Use AWS Route 53 (or the clientâ€™s preferred DNS service) to set up domain names as required.
- **AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store:**
  - Store environment-specific parameters (e.g., database credentials, API keys) for use in the application and infrastructure deployments.
- **Set Up CodePipeline:**
  - **Source:** Set the pipeline source to an S3 bucket containing the application as a ZIP file.
    - Ensure the S3 bucket allows access from CodePipeline and contains the required ZIP file.
  - **Example Pipeline Configuration:**
    ```yaml
    Source:
      S3:
        Bucket: <source-bucket-name>
        ObjectKey: <source.zip>
    ```
- **Approval and SNS Notification:**
  - Add a manual approval action in the CodePipeline:
    - Use the `Approval` action in the pipeline stages to pause the pipeline and wait for manual confirmation.
  - **SNS Notifications:**
    - Create an SNS topic and subscribe relevant email addresses to receive notifications.
    - Integrate the SNS topic with CodePipeline to send notifications on events such as successful deployments, failures, or when an approval action is pending.
  - **Example Notification Configuration:**
    ```yaml
    Stages:
      - name: ApprovalStage
        Actions:
          - name: ManualApproval
            ActionType: Approval
            NotificationARNs: 
              - arn:aws:sns:<region>:<account-id>:<topic-name>
    ```

### 3. Sync with Client Buckets Using Prefix from Lambda (Estimated Time: 5 Hours)

- **Create a Lambda Function:**
  - Use AWS Lambda to handle the synchronization of artifacts between the main S3 bucket and client-specific buckets using prefixes.
  - Ensure the Lambda function is triggered by S3 events (e.g., when a new object is uploaded to the source bucket).
- **Lambda Synchronization Logic:**
  - Write the Lambda function to identify objects using prefixes and copy them to the appropriate client bucket.
  - **Example Code Snippet (Python using `boto3`):**
    ```python
    import boto3

    s3 = boto3.client('s3')

    def lambda_handler(event, context):
        source_bucket = '<source-bucket>'
        client_buckets = ['<client-bucket-1>', '<client-bucket-2>']
        prefix = '<prefix>'
        
        for record in event['Records']:
            key = record['s3']['object']['key']
            
            # Copy object to client buckets using prefix
            for bucket in client_buckets:
                s3.copy_object(
                    CopySource={'Bucket': source_bucket, 'Key': key},
                    Bucket=bucket,
                    Key=f"{prefix}/{key}"
                )
    ```
- **Testing and Validation:**
  - Test the Lambda function to ensure it correctly copies objects to client buckets with the specified prefix.
  - Validate that the copied objects are accessible and meet the client's requirements.

## Notes

- Ensure that the S3 buckets used in this process have appropriate access policies, allowing Lambda and CodePipeline to interact with them securely.
- For the **CodePipeline approval process**, you may configure multiple approval stages based on project requirements to involve different stakeholders.
- The estimated times provided for each step are based on typical implementation durations; adjust as needed based on project complexity and specific client requirements.
