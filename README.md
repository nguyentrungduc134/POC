# README: CodePipeline and CloudFormation Artifacts Management

This document outlines the steps required to set up an automated deployment process using AWS services. The focus is on outputting CodePipeline and CloudFormation artifacts to S3, synchronizing with client buckets using AWS Lambda, and configuring DNS, parameters, and approval processes.

## Overview

1. Output CodePipeline and CloudFormation artifacts to separate S3 buckets.
2. Sync with client buckets using a prefix from an AWS Lambda function (Estimated Time: 5 hours).
3. Set up DNS, parameters, CodePipeline, and approval processes (Estimated Time: 5 hours).
    - Use an S3 ZIP file as the source for the pipeline.
    - Set up an approval stage and SNS notifications for the pipeline.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Output CodePipeline and CloudFormation Artifacts to Separate S3 Buckets

- **Create S3 Buckets:**
  - Create two separate S3 buckets:
    - One for CodePipeline application artifacts (e.g., code builds, deployments).
    - One for CloudFormation templates (e.g., infrastructure templates, stacks).
- **Configure CodePipeline:**
  - Define output artifact locations in the CodePipeline YAML or JSON configuration file.
  - Example:
    ```yaml
    Artifacts:
      - name: application-artifacts
        location: s3://<codepipeline-artifacts-bucket>
      - name: cloudformation-templates
        location: s3://<cloudformation-templates-bucket>
    ```
  - Ensure that the specified buckets have the correct permissions for CodePipeline to upload artifacts.

### 2. Sync with Client Buckets Using Prefix from Lambda (Estimated Time: 5 Hours)

- **Create an AWS Lambda Function:**
  - Use Lambda to handle synchronization of artifacts between the main S3 bucket and the client-specific buckets using prefixes.
  - Trigger the Lambda function on S3 events, such as object creation in the source bucket.
- **Implementation:**
  - Write the Lambda function to copy objects to the appropriate client buckets, applying the prefix as needed.
  - Example Lambda function (Python using `boto3`):
    ```python
    import boto3

    s3 = boto3.client('s3')

    def lambda_handler(event, context):
        source_bucket = '<source-bucket>'
        client_buckets = ['<client-bucket-1>', '<client-bucket-2>']
        prefix = '<prefix>'
        
        for record in event['Records']:
            key = record['s3']['object']['key']
            
            # Copy object to client buckets with the specified prefix
            for bucket in client_buckets:
                s3.copy_object(
                    CopySource={'Bucket': source_bucket, 'Key': key},
                    Bucket=bucket,
                    Key=f"{prefix}/{key}"
                )
    ```
- **Testing:**
  - Test the Lambda function by uploading a file to the source bucket to ensure it triggers correctly and synchronizes files to client buckets with the specified prefix.

### 3. Setup DNS, Parameters, CodePipeline, and Approval from Client Site (Estimated Time: 5 Hours)

#### Step 3.1: Setup DNS and Parameters

- **DNS Setup:**
  - Use AWS Route 53 (or the client’s preferred DNS service) to set up DNS entries as required by the client site.
- **AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store:**
  - Store environment-specific parameters (e.g., database credentials, API keys) using the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store.
  - These parameters will be used during the CodePipeline and CloudFormation execution to manage the environment configuration.

#### Step 3.2: Setup CodePipeline

- **Create CodePipeline:**
  - Define the pipeline stages:
    - **Source Stage:** Set the source of the pipeline to an S3 bucket containing the application’s ZIP file.
    - **Example Configuration:**
      ```yaml
      Source:
        S3:
          Bucket: <source-bucket-name>
          ObjectKey: <source.zip>
      ```
  - **Output Artifacts:** Configure the pipeline to output artifacts to the appropriate S3 buckets created in step 1.

#### Step 3.3: Setup Approval and SNS Notification

- **Approval Action:**
  - Add a manual approval action to the pipeline to ensure deployment requires confirmation before proceeding.
  - Example approval action in the pipeline configuration:
    ```yaml
    Stages:
      - name: ApprovalStage
        Actions:
          - name: ManualApproval
            ActionType: Approval
    ```
- **SNS Notification:**
  - Create an SNS topic for sending notifications.
  - Subscribe relevant stakeholders to the SNS topic to receive notifications regarding pipeline status.
  - Integrate the SNS topic with CodePipeline for notifications on pipeline events (e.g., pending approvals, successful deployments, failures).
  - Example configuration:
    ```yaml
    Notifications:
      - arn: arn:aws:sns:<region>:<account-id>:<sns-topic-name>
    ```

## Notes

- **Permissions:** Ensure that S3 buckets, Lambda functions, and CodePipeline have the necessary IAM roles and policies for access and execution.
- **Testing:** After setting up the pipeline, conduct a full test by uploading a ZIP file to the source S3 bucket to verify that:
  - Artifacts are stored in the correct S3 buckets.
  - The Lambda function correctly synchronizes with client buckets.
  - CodePipeline triggers the approval stage and sends notifications as expected.
- **Estimated Time:** The estimated time for each step is based on typical scenarios and may vary based on the complexity of the client’s infrastructure and requirements.
